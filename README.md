# AUTOMATED-CASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The judicial system in Kenya faces significant challenges, including case backlogs, corruption, and resource constraints, which hinder the timely and effective delivery of justice. Traditional court procedures are often slow, labor-intensive, and costly, exacerbating delays and inefficiencies. This study explores the integration of automation into judicial processes as a solution to these issues. By leveraging technological advancements, the research aims to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of court operations.The project investigates the design and implementation of a web-based case management system, emphasizing electronic filing, automated case tracking, and document handling. Through a comprehensive literature review and analysis of existing automation technologies in the judiciary, the study identifies key areas where automation can significantly reduce manual labor, minimize human errors, and expedite case processing times.Empirical data from various judicial systems, including the successful implementation of Electronic Case Management Systems (ECMS) in Australia and other countries, provides a foundation for evaluating the potential benefits of automation in the Kenyan context. The findings indicate that automating routine judicial tasks not only improves operational efficiency but also fosters greater consistency and public trust in the judicial system.Ultimately, this project contributes to ongoing efforts to streamline judicial processes through automation, aiming to improve justice delivery and ensure fair and timely access to legal processes for all citizens. The recommendations provided are intended to guide the integration of automation technologies into Kenyaâ€™s judiciary, promoting a more just and equitable society.
